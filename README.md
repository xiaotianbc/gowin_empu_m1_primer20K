# gowin_empu_m1_primer20K

移植gowin_empu_m1项目到sipeed Tang Primer 20K开发板上，主要修改了一些引脚，以适应开发板。除了RGMII接口，板子上没有对应的外设以外，其他外设都已经引出，具体可以在约束文件中查看。

gowin_empu_m1是一个在高云FPGA上运行cortex-M1软核的项目.

The gowin_empu_m1 project was transferred to the sipeed Tang Primer 20K development board, and some pins were mainly modified to adapt to the development board. Except for the RGMII interface, there is no corresponding peripheral on the board, other peripherals have been extracted, which can be checked in the constraint file for details.

gowin_empu_m1 is a project running cortex-M1 soft core on a GOWIN FPGA.
